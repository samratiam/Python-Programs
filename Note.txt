-Iterables have __iter__ method and don't have __next__
-Iterators have __next__ method as well as __iter__
To check whether iterable or iterator use dir(name) and check those methods in the list
For example list is iterable but not iterator

From iterable we can make iterator object
Iterator are all object we can use loop
But we use loop in iterable as well but in fact it will be using iterator object

Python Function as a First Class Citizen:

a) Functions can be stored in a variable and can be executed with
   the variable name from anywhere in the program.
b) A Function can be passed to another function as an argument.
c) A Function can be returned from a function


Criteria for the Closure:

a) There must be a nested function
b) The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function
c) The enclosing function must return the nested function

-Decorators are the function which take our function as an argument and returns other
function adding some extra functionality to our actual function

-If an object defines any descr.__get__(self,obj,type=None) ,
descr.__set__(self,obj,value), descr.__delete__(self,obj) then it
is called Descriptor.
If an object defines __set__() or __delete__(), it is considered a data descriptor/
Descriptors that only define __get__() are called non-data descriptor

-Class Methods
It is a method that is bound to a class rather than object, shared among all objects.
The @classmethod decorator is a builtin function decorator that is an
expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined.
A class method receives the class as implicit first argument. It can modify
a class variable that will be applicable to all instances.
It is used to create factory methods.
-Factory methods
It is the method which return a class object( like constructor) for different use cases
-Static methods
They are bound to a class rather than its object.
You can use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method.
Don't require require a class instance creation(object)
Doesn't take self nor a cls parameter (class parameter) but can have normal arguments or parameter only.

-File Handling
-Binary and Text Mode
-Text files: Web standards like html,css, Source code, documents,tabular data like csv,configuration
-Binary files: Document files like doc,pdf, images,video,audio,archive,database,archive,exe
In text mode, we get strings when reading from the file
While binary mode returns bytes objects without any encoding
read() reads file as string
readline() read as string with newline but readlines() reads files as list with each list item represents a line
Similar to write() and writelines()
